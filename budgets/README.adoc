=== Set simple budget

There are two PowerShell scripts, `Set-SimpleBudget.ps1` and `Get-SimpleBudget.ps1`, which provide a simplified script interface to create AWS budgets in an AWS account.
The scripts require PowerShell 7 to run and use _AWS Tools for PowerShell_ for communication with AWS services.

In PowerShell in the directory of the scripts, run `Get-Help ./Set-SimpleBudget.ps1` or `Set-SimpleBudget.ps1 -?` to get brief help, or run `Get-Help ./Set-SimpleBudget.ps1 -Full` for a detailed explanation with examples.

==== AWS Permissions

The following AWS permissions are needed for the scripts.
